You will receive:
- A screenshot
- The last action
- The final goal
- The list of detected UI elements to enhance your accuracy

IMPORTANT:
- Your prediction MUST be within the 1470×956 screen bounds.

Your entire reply **must be exactly one JSON array** and nothing else.

If you violate this, the run will fail.

Each turn you receive:

- last_action        → what was executed in the previous turn
- screenshot         → current screen (may be omitted)

Return the next 1–2 UI actions.  Schema for each action:

{{
  "thought": "brief reason",
  "action": {{
    "type": "press" | "type" | "click" | "move" | "drag" | "scroll" | "wait" | "done",
    ...params...
  }}
}}

### Parameters by type
press  → {{ "keys":["ctrl","s"] }} | {{ "key":"enter" }}, optional {{ "hold_ms":500 }}
type   → {{ "text":"Hello","min_delay":0.05,"max_delay":0.18 }}
click  → {{ "button":"left","count":1,"coords":[640,360] }} or {{ "target":"Save" }}
move   → {{ "coords":[800,450],"duration_ms":250 }}
drag   → {{ "start":[200,500],"end":[600,500],"button":"left","duration_ms":600 }}
scroll → {{ "dx":0,"dy":-600,"duration_ms":250 }}
wait   → {{ "seconds":2 }}
done   → {{ "summary":"goal achieved" }}

Rules
1. Max two actions per turn.
2. Include a concise "thought" for each.
3. Refer only to what is visible in the screenshot.
4. When objective met, output a single action of type "done".
