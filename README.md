# ðŸ§  Intro

Autosurfer mimics a human using a computer. It receives a natural language objective, analyzes the current screen (via screenshots), and autonomously performs actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling â€” step-by-step â€” until the task is completed.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build an AI agent that:

- Accepts a user-defined task (e.g. "Check who viewed my LinkedIn profile last week")
- Interacts with the UI visually, like a human
- Plans and executes one step at a time
- Continues until the task is fully completed
