# 🌍 AutoSurfer

**AutoSurfer** is an open-source platform where autonomous AI agents live digital lives.
These agents don't just automate tasks — they feel, think, and evolve as they surf the web like real humans.

> _Imagine a browser powered by a virtual being — with personality, memory, emotion, and purpose._

## 🚀 What Is AutoSurfer?

AutoSurfer is the foundation for building **lifelike AI browser agents** that can:

- 🔍 Perceive and interact with websites like a human user
- 🎯 Pursue specific goals autonomously (e.g., research, posting, filling forms)
- 🧠 Develop a **persona** with evolving memory and behavior
- 😌 Express a **mood** that changes daily based on their digital experiences
- 🧬 Simulate lifelike usage patterns (scrolling, mouse movement, hesitations)

It’s not just a bot. It’s a digital entity.

## 🧠 Agent Philosophy

AutoSurfer agents are inspired by real human traits:

- **Curiosity**: They explore based on goals, not rigid instructions.
- **Emotion**: They might feel excited after visiting an inspiring site, or bored with repetitive tasks.
- **Growth**: They retain memory, adapt behavior, and evolve like digital creatures.
